# Rust CRUD Api Frontend

In this code I build a frontend in react for Rust CRUD api's. build login and register form. 

In this frontend code,

1. Get all the data from database
2. Get data using Id
3. Delete the data using Id
4. Create or Insert the data into database.

For this operation I made saperate forms for individual operations like Create, Get all Data, Delete.
